After the upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, the profiles can be migrated manually to the /etc/tuned/ directory with the help of the 'tuned' and 'tuned-profiles' manual pages and 'tuned' documentation.
Customized and third party tuned profiles are backed up in 'TUNED_BACKUP_DIR'.
For more information about 'tuned', see [link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/performance_tuning_guide/index#chap-Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-Performance_Tuning_Guide-Tuned].
