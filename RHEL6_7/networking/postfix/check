solution "To upgrade your configuration, type:\
  postfix upgrade-configuration"

solution "To use a postscreen daemon, restart the postfix service \
by typing:
  systemctl restart postfix"

solution "There is a new smtpd_relay_restrictions parameter with the built-in
default settings:

    smtpd_relay_restrictions =
    permit_mynetworks
    permit_sasl_authenticated
    defer_unauth_destination

This safety net prevents open relay problems due to mistakes
with spam filter rules in smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

If your site has a complex mail relay policy configured under
smtpd_recipient_restrictions, this safety net may defer mail that
Postfix should accept.

To fix this safety net, take one of the following actions:

- Set smtpd_relay_restrictions empty, and keep using the existing
  mail relay authorization policy in smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

- Copy the existing mail relay authorization policy from
  smtpd_recipient_restrictions to smtpd_relay_restrictions.

There is no need to change the value of smtpd_recipient_restrictions."
